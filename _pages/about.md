I'm currently a tenure-track associate professor at [John Hopcroft Center](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). From September 2020 to April 2025, I worked at Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/) and [Prof. Shengyu Zhang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~syzhang/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from The South China University of Technology in 2016. I received the Best Paper Award at DLP-RecSys 2023.

My research interests span large language models and recommendation algorithms. Specifically, my work focuses on: (a) Designing AI agents with long-term memory, reflection capabilities, and tool intelligence; (b) Advancing next-generation recommendation models powered by LLMs, with a particular focus on developing autonomous personalized agents for real-world applications.
