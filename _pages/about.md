I'm currently a tenure-track associate professor at [John Hopcroft Center](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received my PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/) and [Prof. Shengyu Zhang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~syzhang/) in 2020. Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in Compter Science and Technology from South China University of Technology in 2016.

My research interests span large language models and recommendation algorithms. Specically, my research focuses on (a) Designing AI agents with long-term memory, reflection, and tool intelligence; (b) Advancing the development of next-generation recommendation models with the help of LLMs, investigating autonomous personalized agents for real-world tasks.
